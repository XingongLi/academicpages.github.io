My research is in the field of spatial data science and technology with a focus on mapping and analysis of surface water resources. I teach spatial programming, spatial data analysis, and geospatial technology applications in water resources. 

My official and more stable web site is <a href="https://geog.ku.edu/xingong-li">here</a>. This web site has more dynamic contents related with my research, teaching and some other interests.

This site is still under construction. Please come back later.
